You love building software that directly enables your team to crack critical business challenges. You've shipped production applications and can strike the right balance between shipping fast for immediate impact and long-term vision. You enjoy working remotely along with the independence and responsibility that comes with that.
Real estate is the world's largest asset class, but experience in the domain is not required. What is necessary is motivation to dive in and understand the work people do every day so you can build the right tools that give them leverage. The idea of building & running a $150M/yr business that operates like a startup, growing at 5-7%/yr (not a startup looking for PMF) is exciting to you.
